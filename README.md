# ValueHunt

Welcome to ValueHunt, an innovative website that utilizes the power of artificial intelligence to 
help you find the best deals on clothes online. Our unique platform allows users to simply upload 
a photo of the clothing item they are interested in, and our AI model extracts key information about 
the category, color and style. We then use this information to search across top e-commerce platforms like 
Amazon, Flipkart, Ajio, and Myntra to provide you with the lowest possible price for that particular 
clothing item.

## About

This project is in the field of e-commerce and artificial intelligence. We use cutting-edge AI 
algorithms to analyze images and extract key attributes of clothing items, such as :

- Category -> ('Cap', 'Hoodie', 'Jeans','Shirt', 'Shoes', 'T-Shirt', 'Vest')  
- Color -> ('black', 'blue', 'brown', 'green', 'grey', 'orange', 'pink', 'purple', 'red',  'silver',  'white',  'yellow') 
- Style -> ('chevron', 'floral', 'plain', 'polka dot', 'stripes'),

in order to help users, find the best deals. Our project relies on sophisticated machine learning 
techniques to analyze and compare vast amounts of data from multiple e-commerce platforms in 
real-time, in order to deliver the most up-to-date information to our users.

Our platform has significant technological and socio-economic relevance as it helps solve a major 
problem faced by many online shoppers - the inability to fully understand the attributes of clothing 
items and their respective prices. Our solution streamlines the online shopping process by 
simplifying the search and filtering of clothing items based on color and style, leading to more 
informed and cost-effective purchases. In addition, our project has the potential to create a positive 
economic impact by allowing consumers to save money on their purchases, and potentially 
increasing sales for e-commerce retailers.
